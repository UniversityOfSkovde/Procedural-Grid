# Procedural Grid
Grid system for Unity that generates and updates a square grid of objects. Each object can then generate its own geometry based on information abou tits neighbours.

## Installation
You can add this package to your project by going to `Window -> Package Manager -> + -> Add Package From git URL...` and then enter `https://github.com/UniversityOfSkovde/Procedural-Grid.git`.

## Getting Started
To try out the grid, first you need something that can draw to the scene view. Create a new script and call it "Piece". Add the following:
```csharp
using Grid;
using UnityEngine;

[RequireComponent(typeof(GridTile))]
public class Piece : MonoBehaviour {
    private void OnDrawGizmos() {
        var tile = GetComponent<GridTile>();
        if (tile.GetProperty(GridTileProperty.Solid)) {
            Gizmos.color = Color.red;
        } else {
            Gizmos.color = Color.green;
        }
        Gizmos.DrawCube(transform.position, new Vector3(1, 0.1f, 1));
    }
}
```

Go back to Unity, right-click in the hierarchy and create a new Empty GameObject, and drag the new script into its inspector panel. It should render a flat, green cube in the scene view. Try pressing the top-left checkbox in the "GridTile" component to make the tile solid. that you make the tile red.

To get a complete grid and not just a tile, click and drag the game object from the hierarchy into the Assets-panel to create a new prefab. Then delete the object from the scene. Right-click in the hierarchy and create a new Empty GameObject. This time, add the existing component "Grid" to it (the C#-script, not the built-in Unity component). As the "Tile Prefab", pick the prefab you just created. The object will automatically generate a grid of instances for you. If you click on one of them, you will see that the "neighbours" checkboxes in the "GridTile"-component are disabled. They will automatically get the value from their neighbours. You can use that information in your script like this:

```csharp
if (tile.GetNeighbourProperty(0, GridTileProperty.Solid)) {
    Gizmos.color = Color.yellow;
}
```

Each neighbour has an index. The indices goes in counter-clockwise order starting at the neighbour to the right (index = 0), then up-right (index = 1), then up (index = 2) and so on. `GridTileProperty` is an enum that defines all the boolean properties that can be stored in the grid. By default, it has two properties; `Solid` and `Water`. If you locate this enum in the package, you can change it and the GUI will automatically pick up the new properties.
